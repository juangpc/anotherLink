HPI - make it stable
    - try to make it all but visualization c++
    - Qt only for visualization.
    - dipole fitting c++.
    *==> adventure into opengl and vulkan
    *==> adventure into linux(Xlib)/iOS(Cocoa)/Windows(Direct3d)

VIRTUAL MEG - *just* in case there is some trouble.
            - understand and improve neuromag2ft
                - replicate the source of time-series **as closely as p**
                - make it automatic and **reloadable** (if measurement restarts)
                --> nice if it is stable enought to run by default 24/7
                - avoid dependencies.
                    - c++ only fiff library (well abstracted)
